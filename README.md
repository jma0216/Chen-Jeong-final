 We worked together in creating the forking processes together, i/o redirection. Mina created the launched prompt while I created the adding/changing of the environment 
variables. We worked together by collaborating and getting the logistics of the project and corrected each other in small logic errors here and there.
 
We both upheld our individual commitments very well. We were both timely and were able to uphold our commitments to each other in terms of the amount
of workload we decided on. Overall our teamwork was beneficial in that we both did our assigned commitments and also helped each other out with shared
work. We also were able to work through each other, catching one another in logic errors that we would have missed if programming by ourselves.
